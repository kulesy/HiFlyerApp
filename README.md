A personal project during the downtime when my internship ended. It is an eCommerce web application simulating a shoe store integrated with the Shopify GraphQL API. 

This was built using Blazor WASM, .NET Web API, and StrawberryShake (a package for sending GraphQL requests).

When looking back on this project I find the REST API that we first must call to make the subsequent GraphQL request redundant. I found this project enjoyable, as I could exercise everything I learned from my internship, such as the SOLID and DRY principles using .NET technologies.
